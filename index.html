          ML methods are being widely adopted for scientific research.

          Compared to older statistical methods, they offer increased predictive accuracy, the ability to process large
          amounts of data, and the ability to use different types of data for scientific research, such as text, images,
          and video.
        </p>
        <!-- cite validity and generalizability -->
        <p>
          However, the rapid uptake of ML methods has been accompanied by concerns of <a
          href="">validity</a>, <a
            href="https://reproducible.cs.princeton.edu/">reproducibility</a>, and <a
            href="">generalizability</a>.

          These failures can hinder scientific progress, lead to false consensus around invalid claims, and can
          undermine the credibility of ML-based science.
        </p>

        <p>
          ML methods are often applied and fail in similar ways across disciplines.

          In this project, we aim to provide clear reporting standards for ML-based science, which take the form of a
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KStvJKTYg1aVet5VG6et1rHoQUszGeaN/edit">checklist</a> and a 
          paired set of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uLAqc5x6RrzpywMOmNJaKmJJ2twmtWmK/edit">guidelines</a>.

        </p>

        <p>
          We developed the reporting standards based on a consensus of <a href="#about">19 researchers</a> across
          computer science, mathematics, social sciences, and health research.
        </p>

        <h4 class="navitems" id="motivation"> Improving reporting standards helps avoid common ML pitfalls </h4>

        <p>
          Clear expectations for using ML methods can allow researchers and referees to 
          <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435615001717">spot issues early</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the use of ML methods across disciplines, there are no widely applicable best practices for reporting
          the design, implementation, and evaluation of ML-based science.

          This leads to different, and often no fixed reporting standards in each field adopting ML methods.

          As a result, common failure modes in using ML methods recur across disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of this paper is to set reporting standards for ML-based science.

          To that end, we develop a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KStvJKTYg1aVet5VG6et1rHoQUszGeaN/edit">checklist</a> 
          and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uLAqc5x6RrzpywMOmNJaKmJJ2twmtWmK/edit">guidelines</a> 
          for reporting ML-based science.
        </p>

        <h5>Why a Checklist?</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            Checklists have been adopted in many scientific fields, and they have been impactful in improving
            reporting practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014, the NIH created 
            <a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility/principles-guidelines-reporting-preclinical-research">principles</a> 
            to improve reproducibility and rigor, endorsed by several journals.

            One item was the creation of reporting standards and checklists for journals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The EQUATOR network, which collects reporting guidelines for health research, includes over
            <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/">500 checklists</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several checklists have been proposed in ML methods research.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h5>What's New?</h5>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            Our reporting standards differ from this large body of past work in two crucial ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we aimed to make our reporting standards field-agnostic, so that they can be used by
            researchers across fields.

            We selected items that broadly apply to fields that use ML methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, past checklists for ML methods research focus on reproducibility issues that arise commonly
            when developing ML methods.

            But these issues differ from the ones that arise in scientific research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, past work in both scientific research and ML methods research has helped inform our checklist.
          </p>

        <h4 class="navitems" id="process">Developing the reporting standards - a collaborative effort</h4>
        <p>
          This set of reporting standards resulted from an interdisciplinary collaboration.

          The co-authors share a concern for the validity, reproducibility, and generalizability of ML-based methods
          in their own fields and more broadly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our initial draft of the checklist consisted of items necessary in a canonical ML pipeline.

          We then focused on two aspects of the pipeline: (1) best practices for building ML models that are common
          to ML-based science and (2) common pitfalls in their adoption.

          We also draw from previous efforts at improving the reporting quality of ML.

          In particular, we use three past checklists to ensure our coverage of important items in reporting an ML
          model.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Pineau et al. provide the checklist used alongside <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12206">papers</a> submitted to NeurIPS 2020, a prominent ML methods
          conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Collins et al. provide the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-014-0241-z"><i>TRIPOD</i></a> checklist 
          for prediction models in health research.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Mongan et al. provide the <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.2020200029"><i>CLAIM</i></a> 
          checklist for AI models in clinical imaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose these checklists because they cover diverse modeling approaches and are applicable in different
          settings (ML methods research, models for individual diagnosis and prognosis, and ML for medical imaging,
          respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we had an initial set of items, authors met virtually for a discussion.

          A recurring theme in our conversation was making the reporting standards easy to use.

          To that end, we developed a set of accompanying guidelines to help researchers understand the motivation
          for each section and clarify what is expected for each item in our reporting standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, the authors collaboratively edited the checklist to choose commonly applicable items across
          disciplines.

          We paid close attention to <i>usability:</i> to decrease the time and cognitive load that using the checklist
          would entail, we removed items that were too specific and would apply to a small subset of ML-based science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the authors independently flagged items that were unclear to improve the quality of the
          reporting standards.
        </p>

        <h4 class="navitems" id="standards"> Reporting standards for ML-based science</h4>
        <p>
          Our checklist consists of 35 items across 8 sections.

          <a href="">See the full checklist.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our guidelines accompanies the checklist.

          For each <i>item</i>, we include expectations about what it means to address the item sufficiently.

          To aid researchers new to ML-based science, each item guidelines also identify resources and relevant past
          literature.

          <a href="">See the full guidelines.</a>

        <p>

                        ML-based science has many researcher degrees of freedom.

                        Each design decision can significantly impact the conclusions drawn from a study.

                        This section focuses on clearly and precisely stating the decisions taken during a study's
                        design.

                        This is motivated by recent research which shows that reporting these decisions in adequate
                        depth
                        and
                        clarity is not trivial or common.

                        For instance, Lundberg et al. find that none of the quantitative papers published in a top
                        sociology
                        journal in 2018 report their estimands in sufficient detail.

                    Computational reproducibility allows errors to be uncovered quickly.

                    Independent researchers can verify and build on a study's results.

                    Different preprocessing steps can lead to vastly different outcomes from the modeling process.

                    Even small changes, such as changing the order in which the data preparation steps take place, can
                    lead
                    to large differences in outcomes.

                    For example, Vandewiele et al. find that oversampling before splitting the data into training and
                    evaluation sets lead to widespread errors in pre-term birth detection.

                    There are many steps involved in developing an ML model.

                    This makes it hard to report exact details about the model, and can hinder replication by
                    independent
                    researchers.

                    For example, Raff found that ML results can often not be replicated using the paper's text (i.e.,
                    without using the code accompanying a paper).

                    We ask authors to specify the main steps in the modeling process, including feature selection, the
                    types
                    of models considered, and evaluation.

                    Leakage is a spurious relationship between the independent variables and the target variable that
                    arises
                    as an artifact of the data collection, sampling, preprocessing, or modeling steps.

                    For example, normalizing features in the training and test data together leads to leakage since
                    information about the test data features is included in the training data.

                    Leakage is a major source of reproducibility failures: it affects dozens of fields and hundreds of
                    published papers and can lead to vastly overoptimistic results.

                    We ask authors to justify that their study does not suffer from the main sources of leakage.

                    The performance of ML models is key to the scientific claims of interest.

                    Since there are many possible choices authors can make when choosing metrics, it is important to
                    reason
                    why the metrics used are appropriate for the task at hand.

                    Communicating and reasoning about uncertainty is critical.

                    Still, Simmonds et al. find that studies often do not report the various kinds of uncertainty in the
                    modeling process.

                    We ask authors to report the metrics and uncertainty estimates used in enough detail to enable a
                    judgment about whether they made valid choices for evaluating the performance of the model and
                    drawing

                    ML-based science faces a number of threats to external validity.

                    Since studies that use ML methods are often unaccompanied by external (i.e., true out-of-sample)
                    validation, it is important to reason about these threats.

                    Additionally, authors are best positioned to identify the boundaries of applicability of their
                    claims in
                    order to prevent misunderstandings about the claims made in their study.

        <h4 class="navitems" id="usage"> How authors, referees & journals can use the reporting standards </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Authors</b> can self-regulate by using the reporting standards to identify errors and preemptively address
          concerns about the use of ML methods in their paper.

          This can also help increase the credibility of their paper, especially in fields that are newly adopting ML
          methods.

          We expect the reporting standards to be useful to authors throughout the study - during conceptualization,
          implementation, and communication of the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The checklist can be included as part of the supplementary materials released alongside a paper, such as the
          code and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guidelines can help authors learn how to correctly apply our reporting standards in their own work and
          introduce them to underlying theories of evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Referees</b> can use the reporting standards to determine whether a study they are reviewing falls short.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they have concerns about a study, they can ask researchers to include the filled out checklist in a revised
          version.

          For example, Roberts et al. use the CLAIM checklist to filter papers for a systematic review based on
          compliance with the checklist.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Journals</b> can require authors to submit a checklist along with their papers to set reporting standards
          for ML-based science.

          Similar checklists are in place in a number of journals; however, they are usually used for specific
          disciplines rather than for methods that are prevalent across disciplines.

          Since ML-based science is proliferating across disciplines, our reporting standards offer a method-specific
          (rather than discipline-specific) intervention.
